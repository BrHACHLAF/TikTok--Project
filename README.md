TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and spread joy, empowering users to submit reports on videos and comments. These reports help identify content requiring moderation. However, the influx of reports poses a challenge for timely review. To address this, TikTok aims to develop a machine-learning model for classifying reports as either claims or opinions. With this model, TikTok can streamline the prioritization of user reports, reducing backlog and enhancing efficiency.
